# About me
Hi there! My name is Roel van de Water. I'm 25 years old and I come from The Netherlands. I work as a software developer for Coolblue, one of the biggest webshops in The Netherlands.

I've always been passionate about computers and software development, and I'm happy that I could make it my daily job.

During all those development activities (work and private), I sometimes encounter situations that I just want to write about, and that's exactly what this blog is about.

Lately I've been getting more and more interest in open source, so be sure to check out my GitHub as well, as most of my recent personal projects are publicly available there. I'm pretty sure there is something that might be interesting for you as well.
